## Object-Based-Attention-Boundary-Transformation-Drawings

### Description
This repository contains 500+ drawings of 15 scenes done under two different scene-viewing tasks. Under the search task, participants were asked to find a small target object within the image while memorizing the scene. Under the memorize task, participants were asked just to memorize the scene. Scene images are from Boettcher et al. (2018).
